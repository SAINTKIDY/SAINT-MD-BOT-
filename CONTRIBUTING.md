## How to Get Started

Follow these steps to get involved:

### 1. Check for Hacktoberfest-labeled Issues
We have created issues specifically for Hacktoberfest participants! Look for issues labeled `hacktoberfest`, `good first issue`, or `help wanted` in the repository.

- **[Browse Hacktoberfest Issues](https://github.com/X-Electra/X-Asena/issues)**

These issues are designed to be beginner-friendly and range from bug fixes to new features.

### 2. Fork the Repository
Click the **Fork** button on the top-right of this page to create your own copy of the repository.

### 3. Clone the Repository
After forking, clone your repository locally by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/X-Asena.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 4. Create a Branch
To avoid conflicts, create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b hacktoberfest-<your-feature>
```

### 5. Make Your Changes
Follow the issue description and contribute to the codebase. Ensure that your changes are clean, efficient, and follow our coding guidelines.

### 6. Test Your Changes
Before submitting your PR, make sure to thoroughly test your changes. This ensures the project remains stable.

### 7. Commit and Push
Once your changes are ready, commit them with a meaningful message and push to your fork:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add <feature/fix> for Hacktoberfest"
git push origin hacktoberfest-<your-feature>
```

### 8. Open a Pull Request
Navigate to your fork on GitHub, and youâ€™ll see a **Compare & Pull Request** button. Click it and submit your PR with a clear description of what youâ€™ve done and how it solves the issue.

## Guidelines for Contributions

To make sure your contributions are meaningful and align with the projectâ€™s goals, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Scope
- Address issues that are tagged with `hacktoberfest`, `good first issue`, or `help wanted`. If you're contributing something new, make sure it adds value to the project.
  
### 2. Quality
- Ensure your code is well-structured, documented, and follows the project's coding standards.
- Avoid low-effort contributions such as changing just a typo or adding a single comment, as these may not be counted toward Hacktoberfest.

### 3. PR Size
- Small, focused PRs are preferred. Large, unfocused PRs can be harder to review and may be rejected or delayed.

### 4. Respect the Review Process
- Be patient while maintainers review your code. Constructive feedback is a chance to improve your skills!
